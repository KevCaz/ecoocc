```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.align = "center",
  comment = "#> "
)
library(ecoocc)
```

## Context

The goal of `ecooc` is to implement common ecological methods that deal
with presence absence matrices. Performance was one of the most important
feature the core of the function are therefore written in C++.


## Generating presence-absence 

```{r}
mat <- ec_generate_pa(20, 10, .4)
```

## Rarefaction


```{r}
mat <- matrix(stats::runif(2000) > .9, ncol = 20)
res <- apply(ec_rarefaction(mat, 1000), 1, mean)
plot(res, type = "l", lwd = 2)
```

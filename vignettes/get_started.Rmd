```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
# NOT_CRAN <- TRUE
NOT_CRAN <- identical(tolower(Sys.getenv("NOT_CRAN")), "true")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  purl = NOT_CRAN,
  eval = NOT_CRAN,
  fig.align = "center",
  comment = "#> "
)
library(ecoocc)
```

## Context

The goal of `ecooc` is to implement common ecological methods that deal
with presence absence matrices. Performance was one of the most important
feature the core of the function are therefore written in C++.


## Rarefaction


```{r}
mat <- matrix(stats::runif(2000)>.9, ncol = 20)
res <- apply(ec_rarefaction(mat, 1000), 1, mean)
plot(res, type = "l", lwd = 2)
```
